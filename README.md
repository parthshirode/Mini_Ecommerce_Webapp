Mini Flask E-commerce Web Application
This is a dynamic, multi-user e-commerce web application built entirely in Python using the Flask framework. It simulates a real-world online store by managing all dataâ€”users, products, and ordersâ€”from a single Excel file (data.xlsx), leveraging the pandas library for in-memory data manipulation.

The application features a modern, responsive frontend with a "glassmorphism" design aesthetic, providing a visually appealing and intuitive user experience across all pages.

âœ¨ Core Features
Role-Based User System: The application supports three distinct user roles with different permissions:

Customers: Can browse products, add items to a persistent shopping cart, manage their cart, and view their order history.

Sellers: Can log in to a dedicated dashboard to add, view, edit, and delete their own product listings.

Admins: Have full administrative access, including the ability to manage all users and products on the platform.

Dynamic Product Catalog: Instead of a static table, products are displayed in an engaging, card-based grid layout similar to modern e-commerce sites like Amazon and Flipkart.

Full Shopping Cart Functionality: A complete shopping cart system that allows users to add items, view their cart with subtotals, remove items, and "check out" to place an order.

Database-Free Operation: Utilizes pandas to read data from an Excel file at startup, effectively using DataFrames as an in-memory database. This makes the application lightweight, portable, and easy to set up.

Modern & Responsive Frontend: A consistent and stylish UI/UX built with pure CSS. The design is fully responsive and looks great on devices of all sizes.

Secure Authentication: Implements robust login, registration, and session management to protect user accounts and ensure a secure experience.
